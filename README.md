Project 1: Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to Set Up RDS and Access It from an EC2 Instance

## Objective

This project demonstrates how to deploy a sample web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an integrated Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) database. It also explains how to access the RDS instance securely from an external EC2 instance within the same VPC.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Amazon EC2
- VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- (Optional) AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager, Amazon CloudWatch

---

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account with proper permissions
- SSH key pair for EC2 login
- Basic knowledge of AWS networking and services

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. Open AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console.
2. Create a new application and choose a platform (e.g., Python, Node.js).
3. Upload your sample application or select the sample option.
4. During environment configuration:
   - Enable RDS integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
   - Choose an instance size, DB name, and credentials.
   - Ensure the RDS is launched within the same VPC as Beanstalk.

---

### Step 2: Configure RDS Access

- In RDS settings:
  - Optionally enable **public access** (only if needed).
  - Modify RDS security group to allow access from:
    - Elastic Beanstalk environment security group.
    - EC2 instance security group (configured in next step).

---

### Step 3: EC2 Instance Setup

1. Launch an EC2 instance in the same VPC and subnet.
2. SSH into the instance:

```bash
ssh -i "project-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
```

3. Install a database client (MySQL/PostgreSQL):

```bash
# For MySQL
sudo yum install -y mysql
```

4. Connect to the RDS instance:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -h -p (endpoint)
```

---

### Step 4: Optional Enhancements

- **Secrets Management:** Store DB credentials using AWS Systems Manager or Secrets Manager.
- **Monitoring:** Enable metrics using Amazon CloudWatch.
- **Automation:** Add a test script to EC2 for reading/writing to the RDS database.

---

## Security Considerations

- Never expose RDS to 0.0.0.0/0.
- Use least-privilege IAM roles.
- Store secrets securely (never hardcoded).
- Restrict SSH access to EC2 from trusted IPs or use Session Manager.
- Delete unused resources to prevent cost overruns.

## Commands Reference

```bash
# SSH into EC2
ssh -i "project-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-IP>

# Install MySQL client
sudo yum install -y mysql

# Connect to RDS
sudo mysql -u root -p -h awseb-e-x7hdg5fd76-stack-awsebrdsdatabase-inbhy6m pogps.c7u882mc6jgt.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com

## Notes

- All resources were deployed in the same AWS Region and VPC.
- Security groups were carefully configured to limit access between tiers.
- Application and infrastructure tested and validated end-to-end.
